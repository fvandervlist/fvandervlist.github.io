			<p class="summary"><span class="is-topic"><span class="is-emoji">&#x1f4c2;</span>Platformed Collaboration in Open Source Software Development</span> This thesis considers the technicity of collaboration on GitHub from a software and platform studies perspective. It discusses how software has the capacity to produce and instantiate certain modes of collaboration that are specific to the environment in which that software is implemented. In order to do so, it draws from the fields of new media, software and platform studies as well as from computer and information science, and combines empirical descriptions with feature analyses in terms of their broader implications for collaboration on GitHub. The analysis includes discussion of Git as a system for distributed revision control and source code management, practices of collaboration on GitHub, and information transparency and activity awareness in relation to the implications for computer-supported collaborative innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building. Based on the analysis, I propose that collaboration should be understood as a relational construct between users and their technical supports, as articulated in a specific context. Systems of storage and versioning, access protocols, <i>grammars of collaboration</i>, <i>social regulation</i>, <i>social learning</i>, activity streams or visualisations, and other facets of <i>technicity</i> are all constitutive of the conditions for these context-specific modes of innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building to emerge.</p>

			<h3 id="1-Introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
			<p>The Internet has become increasingly social due to the rise of Web 2.0. There are many different social features implemented in websites, (mobile) applications, and on Internet platforms. These features enable us to continuously communicate with &ndash; but also keep track of &ndash; our friends, distant relatives, or total strangers. However, the productivity changes remain unclear (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dabbish et al. 2012</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Langlois 2011, 2009</a>).</p>
				<p>GitHub&rsquo;s mission to make coding social should be understood as an effort to make collaboration technical. As a digital platform, GitHub<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note1" class="anchor ahref-uri">1</a></sup> is engineering and manipulating the way we connect (cf. <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">van Dijck 2013</a>); collaboration, reputation, innovation, sharing, community, and so on, become <i>coded concepts</i> defined by the owners of the platform. Software developers use GitHub to collaboratively organise the development of projects that span over temporal and spatial distance. With over three million users,<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note2" class="anchor ahref-uri">2</a></sup> GitHub has grown into the largest web-based code-hosting platform. It is important that we should think about how we can understand the platforms we build, for they become constitutive of the way we think, interact, and relate to each other. GitHub determines not only how and what we learn, but also who we learn with, our understanding of innovation, or the way we coordinate our efforts towards a wide variety of shared goals.</p>
				<p>The approaches now known as software studies and platform studies aim to describe these software platforms and mechanisms and try to make sense of them (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Fuller 2008</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bogost and Montfort 2009</a>). The perspective of <i>platform technicity</i> in particular seems to offer a fertile ground to look into the many ways technical rationalities and infrastructures structure and govern the relations between humans and their technical supports (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bucher 2012</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Niederer and van Dijck 2010</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Crogan and Kennedy 2009</a>). By addressing the following research question, we may advance our understanding of how specific material arrangements like GitHub can enable, capture and augment computer-supported collaborative innovation, knowledge building and community building: <i>in what way is the technicity of collaboration on GitHub co-constitutive of computer-supported collaborative innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building?</i> This question is approached from three different, but intertwined angles. Git, the main underlying infrastructure, is first approached as a technical foundation or infrastructure supporting further layers of the GitHub platform that are discussed in the subsequent sections. Second, the practice of collaboration on GitHub is considered by looking into the way specific features augment or serve to deal with particular strengths and shortcomings of Git, and what that means for collaboration. Third, I discuss some of the distinctive features on GitHub that produce activity awareness by constituting an information transparent environment.</p>
			<hr class="dashed" />
			<h3 id="2-Theoretical-Framework">2. Theoretical Framework</h3>
			<p>The following is a reflection on the broader conceptual frameworks to which this research contributes. With a main focus on understanding the &ldquo;technicity&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Crogan and Kennedy 2009</a>)<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note3" class="anchor ahref-uri">3</a></sup> of collaboration on GitHub, this research is situated somewhere between the academic disciplines of software studies (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Fuller 2008</a>),<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note4" class="anchor ahref-uri">4</a></sup> platform studies (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bogost and Montfort 2009</a>),<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note5" class="anchor ahref-uri">5</a></sup> and digital methods (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Rogers 2012, 2009</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note6" class="anchor ahref-uri">6</a></sup> As such, it is grounded in the philosophical tradition of the digital humanities (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Berry 2011, 2012</a>).</p>
				<p>As defined by Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort, a <i>platform</i> is: &ldquo;a computing system of any sort upon which further computing development can be done. It can be implemented entirely in hardware, entirely in software (which runs on any of several hardware platforms), or in some combination of the two&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2009</a>). In their view, a platform often contains other platforms, which is a useful way of thinking about software and platforms from a perspective of technicity analysis. The notion of <i>technicity</i> embodies the key approach of this research to understand the techno-social structure of GitHub. Bucher (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012, 4</a>), and Crogan and Kinsley (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012, 22</a>) both take this concept to be &ldquo;the inherent, coconstitutive milieu of relations between the human and their technical supports, agents, supplements (never simply their &lsquo;objects&rsquo;)&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Crogan and Kennedy 2009, 109</a>). <i>Technicity</i> is why software can be productive (i.e. &ldquo;do work&rdquo; in the world), why it can make things happen. It marries the technical object to the context of which it is part, which is to say that they become mutually constitutive.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note7" class="anchor ahref-uri">7</a></sup> The question of what collaboration is then becomes how collaboration <i>becomes</i>.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note8" class="anchor ahref-uri">8</a></sup> In many ways, this approach answers to Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star&rsquo;s call to start taking infrastructures seriously (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">1999</a>). Infrastructure is defined as a relational concept, embedded in other structures, social arrangements, and technologies (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">35</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note9" class="anchor ahref-uri">9</a></sup> <i>Technicity</i> takes this understanding of infrastructures to the domain of software and platform studies by focusing on the constitutive relations between the technical infrastructures and &ndash; in a broad sense &ndash; specified human actions. With this conceptual and structural frame in mind, I explore the implications on computer-supported collaborative innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building.</p>
				<p>These perspectives are all still in their infancy and in addition to their short existence, the research on software and digital platforms also seems disproportionate to the increasingly pervasive role they play in our (everyday) lives. It has become difficult to even imagine a world without software. This is not just a consequence of being so dependent on automated support mechanisms for our regular activities, but more importantly of a lack of understanding of &ldquo;the stuff of software&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Fuller 2008</a>) in spite of this dependence. As a result, this research draws heavily from a variety of other disciplines such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, organisation studies and other categories of computer and information science. This way we may be able to bridge some of the gaps between technical engineering, development, implementation and maintenance on the one hand, and thorough analytical and critical understanding of their implications on the other.</p>

			<p>GitHub was founded in April 2008<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note10" class="anchor ahref-uri">10</a></sup> and uses Git as system for version control. Git follows the logic of a distributed computer system, so it is necessary to consider this in terms of implications for any additional layers of software and interaction. Previous research and development of distributed computer systems and networks has resulted in broad adoption and implementation (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Milenkovic 2003</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note11" class="anchor ahref-uri">11</a></sup> Peer-to-peer networks and file-sharing practices have emerged and caused scholars to rethink these systems and networks not only on the level of technical infrastructure, but also as models of cultural production, cooperation and distribution (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bauwens 2005</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note12" class="anchor ahref-uri">12</a></sup> A recent example of such a discussion centred on version control systems. Centralised version control systems (CVCS) such as Subversion are gradually being replaced by distributed version control systems (DVCS) such as Git, Mercurial, or Bazaar, for they are much more flexible and able to scale in administration, size and spatial distance (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Tanenbaum and van Steen 2007</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note13" class="anchor ahref-uri">13</a></sup> This spawned discussion on the pros and cons of centralised versus distributed models of version control, how the actual work process is transformed because of this, and specific issues that follow from migrating between two such systems (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">de Alwis and Silito 2009</a>).</p>
			<h4 id="2-2-Computer-Supported-Cooperative-Work">2.2. Computer-Supported Cooperative Work</h4>
			<p><i>Computer-Supported Cooperative Work</i> (CSCW) repeatedly surfaces as the key site of debate for computer-supported group work and its issues especially before the rise of the Web 2.0 era of platforms and peer-production. CSCW started as an interdisciplinary effort to shed light on supporting group activity (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Grudin 1994, 19&ndash;20</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note14" class="anchor ahref-uri">14</a></sup> Irene Greif and Paul M. Cashman first coined the term in a workshop (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">1984</a>) on the role that technology could play in human group work (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Grudin 1994</a>), and was later defined by Peter H. Carstensen and Kjeld Schmidt to describe &ldquo;how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems&rdquo; (1999, qtd. in Itoh 2003, 620). Most of the previous research on CSCW that is relevant here stems from computer science in the eighties and nineties (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Grudin 1988</a>),<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note15" class="anchor ahref-uri">15</a></sup> and now seems to continue in the slightly different context of social computing implementations.</p>
				<p><i>Social computing</i> implementations can deal with some specific issues that could not be resolved before, even though these had been identified at the time (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Schmidt 2002</a>). These are issues of coordination such as lack of awareness and workspace transparency that follow from the move from local (i.e. with physical proximity to other members) to networked (i.e. where members are physically scattered) group working environments (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Gutwin et al. 1996</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Gutwin and Greenberg 2002</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Pinelle et al. 2003</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note16" class="anchor ahref-uri">16</a></sup> This has caused a general shift in development style of open source software from the hierarchical &ldquo;cathedral&rdquo; model to something that resembles a &ldquo;bazaar&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Raymond 1998</a>), resulting in different categories of collaboration such as <i>episodic</i> and <i>continuous collaboration</i> (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Rigby et al. 2010</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#4-3-Nested-Assemblages-of-Code" class="anchor ahref-text">section 4.3.</a>) and the emergence of the endless beta stage of development to harness this collective intelligence (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">O&rsquo;Reilly 2005</a>). In this &ldquo;neodemocratic&rdquo; environment, different values are important that emphasise commitment to issues rather than information secrecy (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dean 2003</a>). As a web-based code-hosting platform for social coding, GitHub has a very particular understanding of publicness. Ownership and influence become concerns of access and permission protocols<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note17" class="anchor ahref-uri">17</a></sup> (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#5-1-A-Reconfiguration-of-the-Public-and-the-Private" class="anchor ahref-text">section 5.1.</a>), causing a reconfiguration of the public and private (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#5-1-A-Reconfiguration-of-the-Public-and-the-Private" class="anchor ahref-text">section 5.1.</a>).</p>
			<h4 id="2-3-Social-Computing-in-Open-Source-Software-Development">2.3. Social Computing in Open Source Software Development</h4>
			<p>Social computing has also been explored specifically in open source software development (&#350;ahin et al. 2013</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dabbish et al. 2012</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Begel et al. 2010</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Fihin 2008). It is not just about notification systems, but also about how specific features actually <i>become</i> social. <i>Social forking</i> (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Fung et al. 2012</a>), &ldquo;light-forks&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Gonz&aacute;lez-Barahona 2008</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Rigby 2010</a>) and <i>merging</i> make particular interesting cases in that they show how code and community are attached to each other (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#4-3-Nested-Assemblages-of-Code" class="anchor ahref-text">section 4.3.</a>, <a rel="internal anchor" href="#5-3-Task-Oriented-Development-Communities" class="anchor ahref-uri">5.3</a>). Code is a social object among developers (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dodge and Kitchin 2011</a>), emphasising the importance of &ldquo;social learning&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bandura 1977</a>), and &ldquo;code literacy&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Berry 2011</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Hayles 2004</a>) as a required skill to participate both as a developer and as a critic (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#5-2-Issue-Oriented-Coordination" class="anchor ahref-text">section 5.2.</a>). The key consequence of this is the implementation of an information-transparant environment that allows for activity awareness to both produce and uphold effective collaborations. The concepts of &ldquo;capture&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Agre [1994] 2003</a>) and &ldquo;social inferences&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dabbish et al. 2012</a>) are useful as frameworks to make sense of this environment (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#6-1-Grammars-of-Collaboration" class="anchor ahref-text">section 6.1.</a>, <a rel="internal anchor" href="#6-2-Tracing-the-Network-and-Participation-Graphs" class="anchor ahref-uri">6.2</a>).</p>
				<p>Research on open source software (OSS) development (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Raymond 1998</a>)<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note18" class="anchor ahref-uri">18</a></sup> has only recently started to embrace the large amounts of data that enables researchers to empirically study software development at large scales and across communities (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Mockus 2009</a>). For example, by using data from user profiles, repository metadata from GitHub, Heller et al. (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2011</a>) were able to visualise collaboration and influence between developers on a map and identify patterns that would otherwise have remained obscured. This kind of empirical research relies entirely on the quality and size of the public datasets with data on profiles, activity, code, and repositories. The interconnections between the global and local (both geographically and as variables on the platform) need to be considered as well. David Redmiles, for example, explicitly chose to use the term &ldquo;global software development&rdquo; to distinguish it from local forms of software development (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Redmiles et al. 2007</a>). This should be considered both as a consequence scale-increases (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Wilson 1996</a>)<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note19" class="anchor ahref-uri">19</a></sup> and of migration across communities such as when <i>code assemblages</i> occur (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Fung et al. 2012</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#4-2-Storage-and-Source-Code-Management-in-Git" class="anchor ahref-text">section 4.2.</a>, <a rel="internal anchor" href="#4-3-Nested-Assemblages-of-Code" class="anchor ahref-uri">4.3</a>).</p>
			<hr class="dashed" />
			<h3 id="3-Research-Methodology">3. Research Methodology</h3>
			<p>In order to address the research question, it needs to be separated into two parts. The first concerns understanding the platform technicity of GitHub, and the second part requires this understanding to make sense of collaboration in terms of innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building. To answer this twofold question, a methodology has been deployed that is similar to those of Bucher (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012</a>), Niederer and van Dijck (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2010</a>), and Dabbish et al. (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012</a>). Their research is similar in that Dabbish et al. develop an understanding of how users infer information and meaning from particular functions on GitHub. Bucher, Niederer and van Dijck, on the other hand, used their empirical findings to open up space for a critical perspective on Wikipedia&rsquo;s standards. It is this particular intention in conducting empirical research that I believe is important.</p>
				<p>The first part of the research question is descriptive, and is engaged as an empirical question. The aim is to develop and describe a functional and structural overview of GitHub to understand which of its many features are important to the research question, and how these features relate to each other. Functional description, in this case, means separating the elements and classifying them based on what they do (in the broadest sense). Structural description, on the other hand, focuses on navigational structure and content organisation. The structural becomes relevant when considering features in relation to one another.</p>
				<p>To engage with this kind of description, one needs to explore and document features and how these are implemented into the system. The empirical corpus, then, consists of descriptions and discussions on the various implemented systems from blogs, previous research, and observation. In this regard, documents on GitHub are often useful. The GitHub team keeps their developer blogs<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note20" class="anchor ahref-uri">20</a></sup> public and up-to-date; GitHub&rsquo;s help subdomain<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note21" class="anchor ahref-uri">21</a></sup> contains extensive description; legal documents such as terms of service,<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note22" class="anchor ahref-uri">22</a></sup> privacy and security statements<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note23" class="anchor ahref-uri">23</a></sup> are all publicly available; an analytics subdomain<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note24" class="anchor ahref-uri">24</a></sup> is dedicated solely to the platform&rsquo;s status history; and user accounts are publicly accessible, including their detailed data such as activity statistics, project pages, repositories and open source code of the projects they have worked on.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note25" class="anchor ahref-uri">25</a></sup> Description alone, however, will not suffice to really understand software. The second part of the research question therefore aims to extend this empirical foundation in order to make sense of the implications of this particular technicity of collaboration on three connected aspects. These aspects are computer-supported collaborative innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building. This means providing what Clifford Geertz and others<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note26" class="anchor ahref-uri">26</a></sup> have called &ldquo;thick descriptions&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Geertz 1973, 3&ndash;30, ch. 1</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Murdoch 1997, 91&ndash;98, ch. 9</a>); describing both an empirical observation, <i>and</i> its broader implications or deeper meaning. This approach criticises &ldquo;thin descriptions&rdquo; of cultural ethnographic analysis that only give empirical findings without contextualising them properly.</p>
				<p>In line with Bucher&rsquo;s essay on the technicity of attention, this thesis will not be focusing on describing what collaboration is, nor will it be an exhaustive study of what all the features on GitHub exactly do. Rather, it will show how software has the capacity to produce and instantiate modes or aspects of collaboration, specific to the environment in which it operates (cf. <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bucher 2012, 13</a>). In what follows the empirical findings and discussion will therefore repeatedly alternate to develop the central thesis. GitHub as knowledge-based workspace is both an infrastructure that can be used through local applications such as the command line interface or the native application,<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note27" class="anchor ahref-uri">27</a></sup> and a web-based platform that you can visit and explore. For the first perspective we may take a closer look at the core infrastructure underlying the platform in order to discuss how computer-supported innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building can result from this foundation. After that section we can then start considering the wide range of features and possibilities that follow from the specific implementation on GitHub. In the final section of the main part this implementation is revisited in the light of activity transparency and awareness on the platform.</p>

			<h3 id="4-A-System-for-Distributed-Revision-Control-and-Source-Code Management">4. A System for Distributed Revision Control and Source Code Management</h3>
			<p>This section will discuss how Git helps producing and instantiating specific modes of collaboration that are specific to the platform. Git is approached here as technical foundation to support functionality that is discussed subsequent sections. First I will describe Git on the level of its distributed VCS architecture, after that I focus on data storage in particular to discuss modes of collaboration.</p>
			<h4 id="4-1-Moving-From-Centralised-to-Distributed-Version-Control-Systems">4.1. Moving From Centralised to Distributed Version Control Systems</h4>
			<p>Version control systems play an important role in the software development process (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Sink 2011</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Chacon 2009</a>). As one of the main project management strategies, source and version control is needed keep to track and structure cooperative software development. Brian de Alwis and Jonathan Silito summarise the key differences between centralised and decentralised systems. According to the authors, decentralised VCSs are succeeding centralised VCSs as the next generation of version control (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2009, 36</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note28" class="anchor ahref-uri">28</a></sup> Realising that a change at the core of the development process will affect the workflow, de Alwis and Silito summarise some of the differences between these systems and describe the rationales and perceived benefits offered by projects to justify the transition between them. In a centralised VCS &ldquo;write-access is generally restricted to a set of known developers or <i>committers</i>&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">37, original emphasis</a>). As a second characteristic, they write, &ldquo;modern VCSs support parallel evolution of a repository&rsquo;s contents through the use of branches&rdquo;. The developers thus require access in order to contribute and earn this by submitting quality work. This way, the quality of a project can be secured. <i>Branching</i> is often used to split the mainline branch of development from the smaller challenges during the development. This way, challenges of different scales can be stored and developed at the same time, and at a different pace.</p>
				<p>Raymond (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2008</a>) refers to DVCSs as a third generation of version control systems and started appearing in the late 1990s and early 2000s (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Harper and Kivilinna 2012, 3</a>). Decentralised systems do not require a central master repository, because &ldquo;each checkout is itself a first-class repository in its own right, a copy containing the complete commit history&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">de Alwis and Silito 2009, 37</a>). Each developer, then, is essentially contributing to his own copy of the project, rather than to a shared project. <i>Branching</i> and <i>merging</i> are also used differently in development supported by DVCS: &ldquo;DVCSs maintain sufficient information to support easy branching and easy, repeated merging of branches. The ease of branching has encouraged a practice called <i>feature branches</i>, where every prospective change is done within a branch and then merged into the mainline, rather than being directly developed against the mainline&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">37, original emphasis</a>). The fact that repositories in a DVCS store the complete revision control history is particularly interesting. Because of it, they lend themselves very well to distributed and disconnected development (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">37</a>). For example, remote locations do not need to have a constantly stable network connection with the central repository, and a change or problem in a single, central repository is not as permanent or dangerous anymore. Every repository is effectively also a backup that reduces the risk of data loss or overwrites involved in such disconnected processes. De Alwis and Silito&rsquo;s research based on the Perl, OpenOffice, Python, and NetBSD open source projects resulted in five anticipated benefits of DVCS over CVCS: &ldquo;to provide first-class access to all developers &hellip; to support atomic changes &hellip; simple automatic merging &hellip; improved support for experimental changes &hellip; [and] support disconnected operation&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">38</a>). For programmers working with these systems on a daily basis, the main challenges seemed to be the transition from one workflow to another, and the compatibility and communication issues that come with it (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">38&ndash;39</a>). Because each clone is a copy of the complete project, there are also legal ramifications to consider for these projects. Once a commit is submitted, every connected developer will have a copy as well. It seems, then, that open source software development and DVCS complement each other in interesting ways and are both fundamental layers of the Git infrastructure (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#5-1-A-Reconfiguration-of-the-Public-and-the-Private" class="anchor ahref-text">section 5.1.</a>).</p>
				<p>Gavin Harper and Jissi Kivilinna discuss DVCSs in the context of open source software development, while also drawing comparisons to traditional CVCSs. The main argument they make is that distributed version control is beneficial to open source software development, but that it is contingent upon project requirements and deployed models of governance (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">1</a>). Just like de Alwis and Silito they note as well that <i>branching</i> and <i>forking</i> make for curious aspects of DVCSs (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">4</a>), because each clone of the project is at the same time a fork or branch (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Fung et al. 2012</a>). However, they also stress that this is not a typical fork, but rather a kind of &ldquo;light-forking&rdquo;: &ldquo;They argue that historical forks where source code of [a] large project is copied under different governance differ significantly from forks whereby a developer makes a small, or insignificant change, ensuring that the core of the project remains unmodified&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Rigby et al. 2011, qtd. in Kivilinna and Harper, 4</a>). DVCSs also stimulate developers to experiment, because any amount of branches can be tested without making permanent changes to a main branch and thereby risking the project development. The result, according to Kivilinna and Harper, is an ad-hoc workflow and interaction between the developers that consists of simple merges and small operations. The use of feature branches may improve the quality-of-code over traditional development iterations. On the level of community, DVCSs also significantly lower the entry barrier for new contributors, for new members to join the development, and for improving learning opportunities for starting programmers. As a result, <i>write-access</i> does not have to be restricted for reasons of quality control anymore (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#5-1-A-Reconfiguration-of-the-Public-and-the-Private" class="anchor ahref-text">section 5.1.</a>).</p>
			<h4 id="4-2-Storage-and-Source-Code-Management-in-Git">4.2. Storage and Source Code Management in Git</h4>
			<p>At the core of a version control system like Subversion is the <i>repository</i>, which refers to a data structure that organises the data in a central location.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note29" class="anchor ahref-uri">29</a></sup> In Git, this works in a similar, but slightly different way. In <i>Pro Git</i>, Scott Chacon notes that DVCSs have no central location for storage anymore, and this has several implications. First, nearly every operation is local. Which, in turn, determines the three states that files can reside in: they can be committed, modified or staged (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">6&ndash;7</a>). Respectively, these states correspond with the three main sections of a Git project: the Git repository, the working directory and the staging area (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">7</a>). Because nearly every operation takes place locally, Git becomes an infrastructure for an environment where individual developers work on projects in a highly disconnected, yet cooperative effort. Obviously, this makes it hard to find and develop projects with complete strangers. The GitHub platform, then, is not so much a hub in the technical sense, but rather a social hub to connect with projects or people and that synchronises individual work into cooperative effort. In that sense, GitHub acts as a matching service. Second, Git has what Chacon calls &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">6</a>). He describes this as follows:</p>
				<blockquote>Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it&rsquo;s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">6</a>)</blockquote>
				<p>Although this may come across as a technical detail at first, it is essential to understand the <i>branching</i> and <i>merging</i> operations that are so important to collaboration on Git. By integrity, it seems, Chacon points to a philosophical consistency in how Git uses <i>checksums</i> to refer to data in the repository. This referring happens via the <i>index</i>, which organises the data in the repository by pointing to specific parts in it. This way, the repository never has to change, and the index can simply refer to all elements that are required in the working directory. This is what the checksum refers to; the unique sum of hash values (in this case of the required elements for a specific point in the development). <i>Branching</i> or <i>merging</i> simply results in a different checksum that can still refer to the same elements in the repository. The repository, then, is a collection of <i>snapshots</i> that can constantly be reused to form new code assemblages. These assemblages occur when different project networks (not just code, but also the associated community and organisation) converge and become integral to one another (cf. <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dodge and Kitchin 2011, 7</a>). If we consider creativity and originality here, this model prefers a model of innovation that is based on combining and reassembling pieces of existing content. This enables &ldquo;remixing&rdquo; from small snippets of code to complete features. Third, Git generally only adds data. As long as you work locally in the working directory, you are vulnerable to data loss. But as soon as you commit the files, it is very difficult to lose or remove data (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">6</a>). A typical workflow in Git starts with modifying files in the working directory, followed by staging them in the form of <i>snapshots</i>, followed by <i>pushing</i> a commit, which permanently stores the staged files in the Git repository (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">7</a>). Contributions are hard to &ldquo;forget&rdquo;, which favors development of software that embodies the logic of a future based on past data.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note30" class="anchor ahref-uri">30</a></sup> Progress is not so much linear as it is materially accumulative. This idea of creating something based on repurposing existing pieces of code supports distributed modes of collaboration that seek to create assemblages. It also raises critical questions whether we should remember everything just because we can.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note31" class="anchor ahref-uri">31</a></sup></p>
				<p>Another major aspect to storage in a DVCS is <i>versioning</i>. Instead of saving changes between files as they change, Git just stores snapshots (Chacon, 5). This has important consequences for the notion of ontology and managing change. Timothy Redmond et al. presented some basic requirements and initial design of a system that manages change to an OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology in a multi-editor environment (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">1</a>). Among the requirements they identified for that system is &ldquo;concurrent editing&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2</a>), which deals with conflicting changes to a project. The interesting thing, however, is that Git doesn't seem to really deal with conflicting changes. Instead of forcing a user to choose between continuing either this version or that version, it just saves them both, suspending the project direction. The outcome is not many dead projects, because projects are sometimes forked, or issues are revisited in discussions months later.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note32" class="anchor ahref-uri">32</a></sup> This tells us that decisions are made and coordinated in a different way. Another requirement the authors identified was &ldquo;complete change tracking&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2</a>). While discussing it, they point to the need to see the history and evolution of an ontology. Although this certainly seems true, the idea of ontologies is itself problematic. As critically discussed by Florian Cramer, ontologies are both useful and problematic: &ldquo;they reference what computers, as purely syntactical machines, cannot process, and which can't be mapped into computer data structures except in subjective, diverse, culturally controversial and folksonomic ways&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2007</a>). If that is true, then the idea of managing change in an ontology might be problematic as well. Certainly there are different interpretations of what progress means, and Git only captures one of these interpretations. Git&rsquo;s idea of progress or innovation seems to be oriented towards endless revisions that are not necessarily advancing towards a common goal. Instead of creating something new, it is often easier to revise something existing. In terms of workflow, this means that what Ian Mortimer calls &ldquo;true originality&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Mortimer 2008, 16&ndash;17</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Hassan 2010, 366</a>) is often overshadowed by &ldquo;routine originality&rdquo;.</p>
				<p>The specific versioning method has become an important point of critique on Git. As identified by de Alwis and Silito (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2009, 39</a>), Koc and Tansel (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2011</a>), and Harper and Kivilinna (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012, 7</a>), the absence of an &ldquo;understandable version numbering system&rdquo; is one of the main disadvantages of distributed systems and results in a less intuitive experience: &ldquo;due to the potentially unclear methods of tracking modifications including a hash of the changeset or a globally unique identifier as a means of identifying the current state of a software project&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Koc 2011, qtd. in Harper and Kivilinna 2012, 7</a>). This makes it useful to consider how this dictates traceability and versioning of modifications. Harper and Kivilinna continue to stress this: &ldquo;In situations where there exists a centralised server containing a single repository, all changes made thus represent the singular state of the software project at a given point in time. However, should this be distributed, there does not exist a single coherent version that can be tracked&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">7</a>). Working without a single version could effectively mean losing the sense of progress towards a final version (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-4-1" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 4.1</a>). This not only makes it harder to coordinate group work; it also becomes problematic to define states in the development of a project, and makes it a lot harder to recruit developers in the first place. The direction, if there is any, constantly changes. If there is no clear direction behind a project, then why should anyone want to spend time and effort on a small or larger project? To answer that, it is necessary to reframe what makes a project in relation to collaboration.</p>

			<p>As far as the system is concerned, projects do not exist. There are only repositories consisting of files and directories, records of changes, the commit objects, and the <i>heads</i> that refer to these objects. To create a new project, one can either create a new repository with &ldquo;<code>&#36; git init</code>&rdquo; and add files with &ldquo;<code>&#36; git add</code>&rdquo;, or clone an existing repository with &ldquo;<code>&#36; git clone [URL]</code>&rdquo;. Each repository has a unique resource identifier (the URL), and if the project is on GitHub it has a project page with an overview of activity, issues, and files, including a &ldquo;README.md&rdquo; (markdown) file that contains an actual project description (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-4-2" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 4.2</a>). For developers, projects may span over multiple repositories.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note33" class="anchor ahref-uri">33</a></sup> Each fork or clone results in a new repository, but may still be part of the same project. A new feature or a version of the software that is compatible with a certain platform is often created as a fork or branch of the main project.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note34" class="anchor ahref-uri">34</a></sup> Another example is the Android project, which started as a fork of Linux and has recently been re-merged with the mainline.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note35" class="anchor ahref-uri">35</a></sup> As separate projects, different distributions developed different solutions to certain issues. This lead to many heated words over what the right solution was to specific issues, or just what <i>thing</i> Android actually was in relation to Linux. What this demonstrates is the &ldquo;torquing&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bowker and Star 1999, 190</a>) that happens when different conflicting classification schemes are being merged. It&rsquo;s not just about merging code; communities, organisations, and ideas are merged as well.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>To describe the work-style where each repository evolves independently of the other, Peter Rigby et al. have proposed the notion of &ldquo;episodic collaboration&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2010</a>). In their words, &ldquo;[t]eams and individuals work independently and in parallel, and then merge later, leveraging git&rsquo;s fast and easy merging&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">3</a>). For another work-style where repositories are shared they introduced the notion of &ldquo;continuous collaboration&rdquo;, which they describe as &ldquo;[t]he scheduler, and the &hellip; networking teams can coordinate work, dividing labor and sharing contributions on a common sub-task via their shared repository&rdquo;. Both are useful models to think about collaboration in relation to Git. <i>Episodic collaboration</i>, for example, accounts for the modularity of code edits that are committed without any knowledge about the endeavours behind a project; committing just for the sake of committing. This can still be very productive, a bit like dialogue or what Lev Manovich termed &ldquo;media conversations&rdquo;. That is, commits become tokens to initiate or maintain a conversation (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2009, 326</a>). On the other hand, <i>continuous collaboration</i> becomes useful when thinking about teamwork and labour division among developers. Maybe the former cannot be counted on, but might be useful for solving difficult issues or initiating new directions, while the latter can be planned and coordinated much more efficiently.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note36" class="anchor ahref-uri">36</a></sup></p>

			<h3 id="5-The-Practice-of-Collaboration-in-an-Open-Source-Software-Repository">5. The Practice of Collaboration in an Open Source Software Repository</h3>
			<p>In the previous section I have shown that the specificities of Git has resulted in ad-hoc workflows, and a particular understanding of projects as nested code assemblages that also contain communities and organisations which are relative to that code. This resulted in two general modes of collaboration that coexist in the same space. It was necessary to discuss Git because it is one of the ways that GitHub is used as infrastructure, but also because it forms the foundation for GitHub as a web-based platform. Continuing this exploration we can now start addressing GitHub. From here on, I look at GitHub as a socio-technical construct to understand how certain features augment or serve to deal with particular strengths and shortcomings of Git, and relate this to the implications for collaboration.</p>
			<hr class="dashed" />
			<h4 id="5-1-A-Reconfiguration-of-the-Public-and-the-Private">5.1. A Reconfiguration of the Public and the Private</h4>
			<p>One of the things that the open source philosophy promotes is free distribution and <i>access</i> to source code and implementation details (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Stallman 1985</a>). This seems opposite to the notion of ownership. N. Katherine Hayles argues that &ldquo;[t]he shift of emphasis from ownership to access is another manifestation of the underlying transition from presence/absence to pattern/randomness&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">1993, 84</a>). Hayles wrote this in the context of what she called the <i>disembodiment of information</i>. When software is not a package deal, but constantly in development, it also loses some of its materiality. The question of accessibility becomes a question of permissions that govern levels of availability and influence. The <i>Help pages</i> on this topic explain these permission protocols: &ldquo;user accounts and organisation accounts have different permissions models for the repositories owned by the account&rdquo;.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note37" class="anchor ahref-uri">37</a></sup> User accounts have two permission levels; the account owner has full control of the account and the private repositories owned by the user. Collaborators have <i>push/pull access</i>. As there are only two permission levels here, there is not much room for protocological hierarchy in the development. Hierarchy on GitHub follows from a different set of socio-technical factors (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#6-1-Grammars-of-Collaboration" class="anchor ahref-text">section 6.1.</a>). Organisation accounts have more levels of access to organise account teams. A distinction is made between <i>owners</i>, <i>admin teams</i>, <i>push teams</i>, and <i>all teams (pull, push, admin and owners)</i>. Axes of permission (parameters) are <i>repository access</i>, <i>team access</i> and <i>access to organisation account settings</i>. To summarise the permissions briefly: the owner can do everything; the admin teams cannot access account settings and cannot add or remove users to the repositories they admin; push teams can <i>push</i> (i.e. write) to the repositories, but cannot access account settings and can only view team members and owners; and all teams can <i>pull</i> (i.e. read) from the repositories, fork, send requests, open issues, edit or delete commits and comments, and edit wikis. In this environment, hierarchy is about trusting someone with the permission to have influence. Ownership, in other words, is still there, but is layered into levels and assumes a different form. The owner is not so much a possessor of property as a maintainer or coordinator of a process. Ownership and direction are intertwined, and the owner is also the lead developer.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note38" class="anchor ahref-uri">38</a></sup> This is because at the other end, the default right of new users is still quite large. Any user can suggest a new direction and fork the complete project, which makes that user the owner of the exact same data, but not of the same community supporting it.</p>
				<p>But then how is consensus reached among the developers? Hayles observed that a shift of emphasis from ownership to access also results in a reconfiguration of the distinction between private and public (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Hayles 1993, 84</a>). GitHub offers private and public repositories, and by paying a monthly amount of money, developers can keep their projects private<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note39" class="anchor ahref-uri">39</a></sup>. By default, a free repository is public. In this particular dichotomy between private and public, transparency of information is less scarce than information secrecy. There is an inherent risk of privacy, and extra efforts are required in the form of security and general cautiousness.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note40" class="anchor ahref-uri">40</a></sup> In the public section of the platform there is a different political architecture, one that seems to be more specific to the Web. Jodi Dean proposed &ldquo;neodemocracies&rdquo; as an alternative to the public sphere (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2003</a>). Instead of the nation, she considers the Web as &ldquo;zero-institution&rdquo; (i.e. as empty signifier that signifies the presence of meaning) where consensus is replaced by contestation; actors by issues; procedures by networked conflict, inclusivity by duration, equality by hegemony, transparency by decisiveness, and rationality by credibility (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">108</a>). This &ldquo;communicative capitalism&rdquo; is a useful step towards thinking about publicness on platforms. In this model, it is key to focus on issues, not actors as vehicles (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">110</a>). Inclusiveness is not scarce anymore, because everyone has a certain degree of access. What matters is duration, or the prioritization of interest and engagement with an issue, rather than inclusion for its own sake (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">109</a>). Decisiveness replaces transparency, because power is not hidden and secret anymore, and what matters is decisive action. When communities gravitate towards issues or projects on GitHub, it is not about rational debate. Consensus is not reached through reasoning, but through quality and credibility behind the commit, which increases reputation. Credibility replaces rationality. This perspective calls for a better understanding of GitHub as an environment where commitment to issues, social status, and reputation management matter. This makes issue-oriented coordination (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#5-2-Issue-Oriented-Coordination" class="anchor ahref-text">section 5.2.</a>), task-oriented development (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#5-3-Task-Oriented-Development-Communities" class="anchor ahref-text">section 5.3.</a>), and activity capturing (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#6-Information-Transparency-and-Activity-Awareness-on-GitHub" class="anchor ahref-text">section 6.</a>) sites of further inquiry.</p>
			<h4 id="5-2-Issue-Oriented-Coordination">5.2. Issue-Oriented Coordination</h4>
			<p>On GitHub, every user can create and view issues on public repositories.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note41" class="anchor ahref-uri">41</a></sup> Introduced in April 2009<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note42" class="anchor ahref-uri">42</a></sup>, an integrated issue tracking system supposedly lets you deal with issues &ldquo;just like you deal with email (fast, JavaScript interface),&rdquo;<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note43" class="anchor ahref-uri">43</a></sup> and allows users to categorise, apply labels to these issues or assign them to someone. Additionally, users can also vote on issues that you want to see tackled, and search or filter for them specifically. In April 2011 they launched the 2.0 follow-up version.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note44" class="anchor ahref-uri">44</a></sup> As units of coordination, issues are allocated as tasks and managed via the <i>Issue Dashboard</i><sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note45" class="anchor ahref-uri">45</a></sup>, which looks similar to an email inbox. An issue has a &ldquo;gravitational core&rdquo;, drawing developers towards a project. <i>Issue Tracking</i> is about managing these issues, but also about integrating the &ldquo;hooks&rdquo;<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note46" class="anchor ahref-uri">46</a></sup> they provide in other features such as <i>Search</i> (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-5-1" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 5.1</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note47" class="anchor ahref-uri">47</a></sup></p>

This shows how issues are implemented into the search feature as units that may be queried. Additionally, a column graph shows the division of different languages over the results, and also acts as another filter.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Three features complement each other and make that issue tracking is <i>integrated</i> into the platform. First, with the <i>assignment</i> feature a particular developer can be assigned to work on a task. Assignment is useful because it is &ldquo;captured&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Agre [1994] 2003</a>) and made visible to other developers as well, which prevents developers from working on the same things, and gives confidence in the project&rsquo;s progress. Second, progress is measured with so-called <i>milestones</i>. <i>Milestones</i> enable the grouping of issues and focusing your issues within time blocks; indicating fixed points on the timeline of a project or issue (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-5-2" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 5.2</a>). Third, <i>issue labels</i> are a simple and powerful addition that lets you add metadata to an issue. To help users on their way in adding useful labels, GitHub suggests some default labels such as &ldquo;bug, duplicate, enhancement, invalid, question, and won't fix&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bitner 2012</a>) (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-5-3" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 5.3</a>). These labels seem to result in a mixture of actual issue descriptions such as &ldquo;bug&rdquo; and issue statuses such as &ldquo;won't fix&rdquo;. Labels are not only useful as organising mechanism, but also enable folksonomy-based filter and search mechanisms. Behind each of these features, the notion of the &ldquo;perpetual beta&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">O&rsquo;Reilly 2005</a>) appears as an implication for collaboration on GitHub. <i>Perpetual beta</i> replaces the software release cycle in favor of the open-source maxim to &ldquo;release early and often, delegate everything you can, [and] be open to the point of promiscuity&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Raymond 1998</a>). There are only versions, which are themselves assemblages of other versions, coordinated through issues. As Jim H. Morris notes, interaction between users and servers go over the net, so they can be recorded and replayed, which can be used for much more effective bug analysis and performance measuring (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2006</a>). It also has consequences for the way features are implemented. They are not distributed as updates, rather it is a continuous feedback loop where features are implemented in rudimentary form and tested by the users. Users thus become passive co-developers.</p>

				<p>A consequence of issue-oriented coordination is the integration of <i>code reviewing</i><sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note48" class="anchor ahref-uri">48</a></sup> into the default workflow. As in any development process, reviewing your own work or the work of other peers is an essential part of the process that both quality and legitimacy often depend on. When source code can be publicly distributed <i>and</i> modified this can create an environment that supports constructive criticism. Assuming that in a typical collaboration not all developers will be professionally trained software engineers, collaborative development will be interdisciplinary in essence. This means that it is also necessary to keep in mind that, to a certain extent, teams become dependent on a number of shared, established concepts and skills. Source code scrutiny assumes a certain level of <i>code literacy</i>. In his introduction to <i>Software Studies: A Lexicon</i> &ndash; a seminal work that tries to establish a common vocabulary that binds thinking and acting together within a professional community (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2008, 9</a>) &ndash; Matthew Fuller identified this required skill as well. Caroline Bassett paraphrases this: &ldquo;Fuller argues that the capacity to engage with code-based production and to engage with technicity of software through the &ldquo;tools of realist description&rdquo; requires certain technical skills, alongside skills that come from disciplines at some distance from computer science and the contained project of realised instrumentality it prioritises&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012, 122</a>). Bernhard Rieder and Theo R&ouml;hle also linked code literacy specifically to source code scrutiny: &ldquo;[the] possibilities for critique and scrutiny are related to technological skill: even if specifications and source code are accessible, who can actually make sense of them?&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012, 76</a>). In order to review code, then, one would first need to learn how to both read and speak code. Moreover, it becomes even more complicated when we consider the amount of different languages used on GitHub.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note49" class="anchor ahref-uri">49</a></sup> Although with 21&#37; of the projects written in JavaScript, there currently seems to be a preference for this programming language.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note50" class="anchor ahref-uri">50</a></sup> However, this is also the exception. Most languages are only used by a tiny group of collaborators, resulting in language barriers. For this reason, there is an overview<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note51" class="anchor ahref-uri">51</a></sup> for each language that shows a number of metrics on projects and the developers about how particular languages have recently been used (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-5-4" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 5.4</a>). On top of different language preferences, programmers also use different vocabularies, naming conventions, or solutions to get something working.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note52" class="anchor ahref-uri">52</a></sup> There is never just one solution to solve any problem, which is exactly why computer programming<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note53" class="anchor ahref-uri">53</a></sup> can be a deeply creative act and why the <i>style of solution</i> is important as well.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note54" class="anchor ahref-uri">54</a></sup></p>

			<p>&ldquo;Social learning&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bandura 1977</a>) is an important consequence of knowledge sharing and community building on GitHub. Developers can collaborate with a shared repository or with <i>Pull Requests</i>.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note55" class="anchor ahref-uri">55</a></sup> This <i>fork and pull model</i> of collaboration allows for independent work by pushing changes, without upfront coordination, and without requiring access be granted to the source repository. Less commitment is required, reducing friction for new contributors. Jerad Bitner notes:</p>
				<blockquote>Pull requests in general are great means of peer review and have helped to keep the quality of code up to everyone&rsquo;s standards. There&rsquo;s a bit of overhead in that it may take a little longer for some new piece of code to be merged in, so plan accordingly. But this also means we find bugs sooner, typically before they're actually introduced into the master branch of the code. (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012</a>)</blockquote>
				<p>By either <i>forking</i> or <i>branching</i>, developers can suggest modifications to the existing code, or contribute new code. The project maintainer then decides which suggestions will be implemented. Four features work together to enable commenting and discussion. First, <i>in-line commenting</i> keeps everyone participating in the project in the loop with changes that are happening. This allows for intervention on the issue-level, which is an important aspect in terms of involvement and influence.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note56" class="anchor ahref-uri">56</a></sup> Second, <i>commit comments</i> can be used to annotate commits with a comment. These comments also show up in activity feeds and each repository has its own comment feed.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note57" class="anchor ahref-uri">57</a></sup> This makes it possible to communicate in a clear and direct way if there are questions or comments on a particular commit. Informal annotation thus becomes part of the process (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-5-5" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 5.5</a>). Third, <i>Gist</i> offers a quick way to share snippets of code with others, and one great advantage is that each <i>gist</i> is also a fully forkable git repository.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note58" class="anchor ahref-uri">58</a></sup> Considering the workflow of a typical programmer, where code is often scraped from a wide variety of places and recombined into something new, this is an important addition to the toolkit. Snippets can easily lead to informal dialogue about objects (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-5-6" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 5.6</a>). Fourth, the <i>blame</i> feature shows you who are responsible for changing each line in any file of a project.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note59" class="anchor ahref-uri">59</a></sup> This is not so much a feature to blame a co-developer for doing something wrong, as it is a resource (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-5-7" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 5.7</a>). It also brings to the fore that every action on GitHub is publicly attributed to a user profile (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#6-1-Grammars-of-Collaboration" class="anchor ahref-text">section 6.1.</a>). This kind of knowledge sharing directly affects community building. When developers find solutions to problems, they often start <i>watching</i> these (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dabbish et al. 2012</a>). They receive updates on the progress and changes as they are made and learn about how others seek solutions to their problems, resulting in &ldquo;development neighbourhoods&rdquo;<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note60" class="anchor ahref-uri">60</a></sup> around issues.</p>

				<p>In an empirical study on <i>social forking</i> in open source software development, Fung et al. (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012</a>) show that forking &ndash; the creation of a new, independent repository by cloning the artifacts from another project (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bauwens 2005</a>) &ndash; is poorly understood as a practice in research, because it is often assumed to be damaging to the open source community.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note61" class="anchor ahref-uri">61</a></sup> According to Jon Loeliger, forking could either reinvigorate or revitalise a project, or it could simply contribute to strife and confusion on a development effort (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2009, 231</a>). By looking into nine JavaScript programming communities on GitHub, the empirical study by Fung et al. showed that: &ldquo;forking was actively used by community participants for tasks such as fixing defects and creating innovations. &ldquo;Forks of forks&rdquo; were also utilised to form sub-communities within which specific aspects of an OSS product line were nurtured&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012</a>). Especially interesting here is the notion of &ldquo;forking a fork&rdquo;, which constitutes a secondary-level, or even tertiary-level fork and indicates a recursive division of issues into ever smaller units. Another interesting observation is that sub-communities are formed and move along with these forked issues. Ultimately, <i>forking</i> is part of the set of features that primarily aim to direct innovation. Instead of submitting commits to a project in development, forking means creating your own independent path. It follows from having an idea about the project that is somehow different from the views behind the initial project. Once forked, the project is treated like any other (it is the default workflow), and as such it can be watched or followed by new users that think alike. Administrative rights (and credit attribution with it) for the fork remain with the user that has created the initial fork. On the social level, this creates an environment where developers gain reputation by having adopted new and interesting projects. Users with a higher reputation according to the system will also have a greater influence in the diffusion of innovations (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Rogers 1962</a>).</p>
				<p><i>Forking</i> produces specific modes of collaboration. To illustrate this, the case of what Jes&uacute;s M. Gonz&aacute;lez-Barahona termed &ldquo;light forks&rdquo;<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note62" class="anchor ahref-uri">62</a></sup> is useful. According to Rigby et al.: &ldquo;In contrast to a fork, a light fork exists when a developer makes specific changes to part of the system, but keeps the core or most of the code the same. An example of this style of fork is a Linux kernel modified for handheld devices&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2010, 28&ndash;29, original emphasis</a>). This emergence of <i>light-forking</i> is a direct consequence of a particular mode of collaboration that is enabled through that feature. In the case of the Linux kernel,<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note63" class="anchor ahref-uri">63</a></sup> for example, there are regular updates in different parts of the tree.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note64" class="anchor ahref-uri">64</a></sup> The authors note that these changes are usually only accepted when they are not too specialised or narrowly focused, which is why the developers must maintain their own light-fork (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">28</a>). Light-forks combine the ability to keep changes in code in version control, while at the same time staying up to date by pulling changes from the remote repository as they occur (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">29</a>). Light-forks are a solution to prevent problems of messy merging processes, but also constitute a unique mode of collaborating that is both continuously up-to-date &ndash; as it maintains its linkages to the remote &ndash; and is at the same time completely yours to work with &ndash; as a separate repository. Still, however, the basic implications for innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building remain the same. Fung et al. make a distinction between two layers of abstraction on which forking is utilised: <i>endogeneous</i> and <i>exogeneous</i>. &ldquo;[The former] occurs within a community of social developers who work on forks for the same software product line &hellip; [and the latter] refers to the creation of forks accross communities of social developers&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012</a>). This distinction shows how forking is linked to community building and knowledge sharing. In fact, one could argue that communities are continuously reassembled because the issues (or forks) they are connected through are continuously imported and exported between different communities. This community merging is interesting to consider as it occurs simultaneously with the merging of code artefacts. In organisations, when such a merger would occur, there are huge consequences and it might take years before a large merge is completed. On GitHub this is not the case, which shows again that an issue-oriented coordination is much more flexible, which (not coincidentally) is also one of the pillars of any good distributed system (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Tanenbaum and van Steen 2007</a>).</p>

			<h3 id="6-Information-Transparency-and-Activity-Awareness-on-GitHub">6. Information Transparency and Activity Awareness on GitHub</h3>
			<p>In the previous section I have argued how the open source philosophy initiates conditions for collaboration on GitHub. Questions of ownership have been rephrased as matters of permission and access, which has caused a reconfiguration of the public and private. In this reconfiguration, issues are the vehicles that guide collaboration, which is reflected in the integration of issue tracking. Communities become task-oriented, which illustrates that collaboration is <i>coded</i> or <i>programmed</i>. When working in the same physical space, there is always a level of awareness of each other&rsquo;s activities. On GitHub, awareness systems attempt to recreate that awareness by providing all collaborators with the same mutual knowledge (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Gross et al. 2005</a>). Awareness systems such as notification systems and activity streams coordinate and synchronise task-oriented collaborative activity. In this section I look at the system as a whole to better understand information transparency and activity awareness on GitHub. The whole is not just the sum of its parts. More is different, because behaviours <i>emerge</i> as a result of a wide array of actions woven together into a global system.</p>
			<h4 id="6-1-Grammars-of-Collaboration">6.1. Grammars of Collaboration</h4>
			<p>The dominant paradigm to achieving activity awareness is to create an environment of information transparency (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dabbish et al. 2012</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Redmiles et al. 2007</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Gross et al. 2005</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Sarma et al. 2001</a>). Activity awareness on GitHub is no exception. Philip E. Agre introduced the concept of &ldquo;capture&rdquo; as an alternative to the surveillance model of privacy issues. For Agre, these models are cultural phenomena. <i>Capture</i> is a set of metaphors that has different components, which he contrasts point-by-point with the surveillance model (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">[1994] 2003, 743&ndash;744</a>). The surveillance model has its origin in political theory, while &ldquo;capture&rdquo; has roots in the practical application of computer systems (e.g. tracking, tracing) (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">744</a>). Tracking systems keep track of significant changes in an entity&rsquo;s state (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">742</a>). We see these on GitHub as well, for instance in the tracing of <i>milestones</i>, <i>forks</i>, <i>branches</i>, and <i>top programming languages</i>. Tracing and attribution of activity occur on every level, which makes <i>capture</i> useful as a structural model to understand how activity awareness is achieved through information transparency. </p>
				<p><i>Grammars of action</i> are central to this model, for they specify &ldquo;a set of unitary actions &hellip; [that] also specifies certain means by which actions might be compounded&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">746</a>). Using examples such as organisational coordination and knowledge representation in AI systems, Agre shows that they are not about specific sequences of input and output, but rather about structuring human action: &ldquo;The capture model describes the situation that results when grammars of action are imposed upon human activities, and when the newly reorganised activities are represented by computers in real time&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">746</a>). Agre then divides the model in five stages that constitute a closed loop: analysis, articulation, imposition, instrumentation, and elaboration. In the elaboration stage, the captured activity can be stored, inspected, audited or merged with other records and is thus subject to analysis again, reinvigorating the cycle (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">746&ndash;747</a>). As a set of linguistic metaphors, <i>capture</i> is not about control or what is visible on the screen, but rather constitutes the rules of the game &ndash; the grammar we are <i>allowed</i> to collaborate through.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note65" class="anchor ahref-uri">65</a></sup> Worth noting is that these grammars do not need to be externally implemented, because action is impossible beyond this grammar. Although challenged<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note66" class="anchor ahref-uri">66</a></sup>, it is useful to consider the capture model &ndash; and <i>grammars of collaboration</i> with it &ndash; for it shows that, from a system point-of-view, the local is connected to the global as two sides of the same coin. The local is found <i>in</i> the global, just as the global is found in the local.</p>
				<p>User profiles are the nerve centres or hubs of activity streams. They show us that each of the pieces of data published is also being captured and processed. In order to <i>track</i> the activity of a developer, there needs to be a certain unique identifier. On GitHub this identifier is coupled with a unique username, to which an account is linked. You cannot collaborate if you are not logged in with the right password. A user profile, then, represents the activity of that, and only that, unique user account (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-6-1" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 6.1</a>). Although it may seem obvious, it is important for tracking as well as attribution. All user activity is captured and processed by the system. Such information is needed to create an information-transparent environment, which creates a sense of continuous awareness among developers that follow each other. To illustrate, consider <i>forking</i> again. Information <i>about forking</i> is used to rank projects in <i>trending</i> or <i>featured repositories</i>, or <i>popular forked repositories</i>. As a programmed action &ndash; where the action is part of a programmed sequence or algorithm &ndash; this data can be analysed and returned as feedback to the user. It is because the actions are captured that they may also be used to publish what has been updated, which in turn can be analysed by the system or its users to infer relevancy (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-6-2" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 6.2</a>). As a second example, the activity visualisations on the user&rsquo;s <i>Open Source Contributions</i> are generated automatically by analysing the quantity of recent activity and returning it as public information afterward.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note67" class="anchor ahref-uri">67</a></sup> This information specifically entails <i>Pull Requests</i>, issues opened, and commits.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note68" class="anchor ahref-uri">68</a></sup> Counting is treated differently than receiving credit. Contributions are counted <i>only</i> if they land in the master branch of the <i>upstream</i>. As long as you are contributing to the master branch in your own fork, it does not count. Credit is received when you open an issue, propose a pull request, or author a commit. Credited or not, all activity will still be part of the public activity feed. As long as the &ldquo;what&rdquo;, &ldquo;when&rdquo; and &ldquo;where&rdquo; are tracked, nothing has to go unnoticed (cf. <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Lessig 2006, 38&ndash;60</a>). This means that collaboration becomes <i>regulable</i>, and because contributions are authenticated (i.e. linked to an identity) the system harnesses complex social values such as status and reputation.</p>

				<p>This regulability thus leads to a second major consequence of information transparency, which could be called <i>recursive awareness</i>. By this I mean the social system constituted by a repeated transparency in a self-similar way that instantiates complex social value systems such as reputation management, and is constituted through ranking, <i>starring</i>, <i>watching watching</i>, member recruiting, and so on. It&rsquo;s easy to underestimate the value of awareness, but as Dan Ariely persuasively argued, people tend to be motivated by a sense of purpose and recognition of their efforts (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2012</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note69" class="anchor ahref-uri">69</a></sup> According to Dabbish et al. there is a sense of &ldquo;being onstage':</p>
				<blockquote>Many of the heavy users of GitHub expressed a clear awareness of the audiences for their actions. This awareness influenced how they behaved and constructed their actions, for example, making changes less frequently, because they knew that &ldquo;everyone is watching&rdquo; and could &ldquo;see my changes as soon as I make them&rdquo;. (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">1284&ndash;1285</a>)</blockquote>
				<p>The authors were also able to identify that <i>watching</i> was inferred as a signal of project quality, because they would assume that if many people track the progress of that project, it is most likely to be good. It is, in other words, a sign of approval from the community. Self-promotion also follows from this effect of being aware of the awareness of others. GitHub profiles are not just profiles; for recruiters they become resumes as well, because they provide a detailed overview of someone&rsquo;s investment and quality of his work (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dabbish et al. 1282</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Begel 2010, 34</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note70" class="anchor ahref-uri">70</a></sup> There is a certain kind of stability when the overview (read resume) tracks and refers to all your activity on GitHub, which is activity that GitHub has accumulated over time and is contributing to the very projects it stores.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note71" class="anchor ahref-uri">71</a></sup> Such stability is possible, then, because information transparency, and awareness with it, is recursively interwoven into a network of captured activity.</p>
				<p>This specific programmed informational environment also instantiates what Dabbish et al. called <i>watching watching</i>. They observed that some respected developers acted as a kind of &ldquo;curators of the GitHub project space&rdquo;. Some people tend to have a similar taste in projects, which makes it useful to <i>watch</i> what others are <i>watching</i>. This is also the case when a certain developer works a lot on specific issues, consequently becoming an expert in that category of issues. As mentioned earlier, it is a programmer&rsquo;s habit to use the knowledge and code that others have developed before them (e.g. copying snippets of code, forking complete projects), resulting in nested episodic collaborations.</p>
			<h4 id="6-2-Tracing-the-Network-and-Participation-Graphs">6.2. Tracing the Network and Participation Graphs</h4>
			<p><i>Metrics</i> are units of measurement that can be used to quantitatively assess a user, process, or event. As such they provide all kinds of information about the system and its use, which, among other things, gives designers of such systems an empirical foundation to improve the system (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Kan 2002</a>). There is a continuous feedback loop between design and usage (e.g. <i>perpetual beta</i>). As input, metrics establish a connection with the physical world, because systems can remember, predict, and adapt.</p>
				<p>The <i>Network Graph Visualizer</i><sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note72" class="anchor ahref-uri">72</a></sup> is a feature that helps collaborators to keep track of what other collaborators have done.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note73" class="anchor ahref-uri">73</a></sup> It automatically visualises the project tree into a schematic representation where a timeline with dates is plotted against usernames (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-6-3" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 6.3</a>). When we relate this to the capture model it means that commits, <i>branching</i> and connected activity are captured and returned to the user in visual form. Along the way, certain assumptions are made regarding the question of what will be useful to the developers for the purpose of coordinating collaborative work. The algorithm visualises all commits, the branches, and the repositories that belong to the <i>network</i>. As Tom Preston-Werner notes, this method concentrates on code and not on ego<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note74" class="anchor ahref-uri">74</a></sup>, which is to say that only contributions are shown that are not yet merged with <i>your</i> version of the project. In other words, it shows only activity that is relevant for the purpose of coordinating parallel lines of development. Another, perhaps less obvious assumption, is the notion that the newest commit is usually the most relevant one for a developer. By default you only see the last month or so, and to see more than that you will have to drag all the way back in time. This obviously makes it harder to find and continue working on contributions from a while back (there seem to be loose ends everywhere), reinforcing the issue-oriented mode of collaboration. In that case it makes sense to work on the newest version, because newer commits will probably have solved (part of) the issue. On the other hand, when the issue is solved, it instantly loses its relevance. Perfectly compatible with the notion of the black box: as long as it works, we should not have to think about it anymore. Is software development really only about making things work?<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note75" class="anchor ahref-uri">75</a></sup> On the level of visualisation, this assumption is also connected to western metaphors of time as a linear, sequential stream of events that &ldquo;just takes us along&rdquo;. Its horizontal, left-to-right orientation is typical of western thought (cf. <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Leong 2010</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note76" class="anchor ahref-uri">76</a></sup></p>

				</figure>
				<p>In addition to the <i>network graph</i>, several other computational graphs are implemented on GitHub as well. These other visualisations can be used to discover who is contributing to a project (<i>Contributions</i> graph), commit activity over time (<i>Commit Activity</i> graph), or additions and deletions during the project&rsquo;s lifespan (<i>Code Frequency</i>, and <i>Punch Card</i> graphs).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note77" class="anchor ahref-uri">77</a></sup> This set of graphs comes with each individual repository, and as such only covers metrics that are relevant to collaboration on that repository.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note78" class="anchor ahref-uri">78</a></sup> All of these visualisations are based on metrics of user participation. In the <i>Contributors</i> graph we get to see who has contributed, when they committed to the master branch, their number of commits (for which they are assigned ranks), and when peaks in activity occurred (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-6-4" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 6.4</a>). In the <i>Commits</i> graph the metrics are anonymised, highlighting patterns in quantity of commits over the course of a year &ndash; not quality or size of these commits (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-6-5" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 6.5</a>).

And finally the <i>Punch Card</i> graph gives a zoomed-in account of the number of commits for each hour of the week (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#Fig-6-7" class="anchor ahref-text">Figure 6.7</a>). The graphs help users to read participation as patterns of activity, indicating to which extent that project is engaged with. It is because these graphs show the larger shifts and dynamics within a project that developers can infer a sense of legitimacy (i.e. communal approval) from them.</p>

				<p>Each of these graphs is continuously updated with new data, showing that the local and global (or human and system) are continuously mirrored back to each other. The input is captured on the local level, but because it is updating in real-time, it is at the same time mirrored in the form of a visualisation; as part of the pattern. Individual contributions are always a fragment of the whole. <i>Mirroring</i> is used as a metaphor here, suggesting both simultaneity and difference, but also self-reflexivity. Looking into a mirror may be confronting, because it shows you things you would not see otherwise. Someone else would have to tell you. <i>Mirroring</i>, as opposed to <i>tracing</i>, may be a more appropriate metaphor, then, because synchronisation happens instantly. In this environment you do not need this other person to tell you anymore; you instantly &ldquo;hear back&rdquo; from the whole community over the whole lifespan of the project.</p>
			<h4 id="6-3-Complementary-Approaches">6.3. Complementary Approaches</h4>
			<p>Now that so many open source projects are being traced and developed in the same technical environment, it allows for new insights into the collaborative software development process (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Heller et al. 2011</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Mockus 2009</a>). In these cases visualisation techniques could be used to locate patterns in large datasets, which could then be the starting point for further research into the emergence of such patterns. As I have tried to argue, there is a complex interplay between human action and the various systems on GitHub. Software has the ability to produce and instantiate modes of collaboration that are specific to the environment in which that software is implemented. This means that digital ethnographic research (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Murthy 2008</a>) and other ethnographic approaches<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note79" class="anchor ahref-uri">79</a></sup> could be a useful addition to understand how the system is adopted on the micro-scale; that is a situated account of how developers on particular projects and in specific collaborative networks use the platform as infrastructure, struggle with conflicts, or solve issues within the limitations set by the systems. One could study different networks of influence and (in)dependencies, self-censorship, the extent to which social and cultural differences are expressed and repressed by the system or the organisations, and many other things. For this kind of research, built-in versioning history, commit history and other analytics may for instance be useful to understand how particular issues have emerged, and how their solutions are constructed. This is what Richard Rogers called &ldquo;in-built reflection or reflexivity&rdquo; in the context of Wikipedia (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Rogers 2009, 28</a>).<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note80" class="anchor ahref-uri">80</a></sup></p>
				<p>As the largest code-hosting platform, GitHub is now the main place where developers working together on open source projects organise themselves. Reputation on this platform has become a currency that has real value outside the digital community as well as within it (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dabbish et al. 1282</a>). Because activity is public, it becomes a space where developers are recruited based on their levels of commitment, quality and number of their commits, and the type of projects they are associated with. Reversely, based on profile information such as organisation and names, developer recruitment on GitHub can also follow from real-world credentials. Another consequence is that, like other collaborative endeavours such as Wikipedia, one of the recurring issues is the assurance of quality control of shared knowledge. As on Wikipedia, this is achieved in part by what Morgan Currie called &ldquo;commons-based peer production&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">226&ndash;227</a>),<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note81" class="anchor ahref-uri">81</a></sup> which emphasises consensus-building over the quality of a single version. Issues are resolved in disconnected instances (e.g. forks, branches) and are later merged with the master branch. This happens in an environment of organisational hierarchy (e.g. upstream, pull or merge requests, access permissions), but versions can always be forked or rearranged into different assemblages and different organisations. In contrast to Wikipedia, GitHub is also not expected to uphold a certain level of consistency and quality control over <i>all</i> its contents.<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note82" class="anchor ahref-uri">82</a></sup> Instead, these concerns are limited to the scale of the project network.</p>
				<p>The social in social coding represents that we do not only look and imitate others, but we can actually <i>learn</i> from that. This is why we are able to accumulate knowledge and increase the pace of learning (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Pagel 2011</a>). Smaller social groups usually equals less innovation, less imitation, and less social learning. Git causes collaboration to be fragmented into communities, but these are not mutually exclusive but nested (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#4-3-Nested-Assemblages-of-Code" class="anchor ahref-text">section 4.3.</a>). Through <i>watching</i>, <i>following</i>, public activity streams, notifications, commit contributions, or discussions you can be part of many different groups at the same time. This means that social learning can easily and effectively spread across these disconnected networks that are connected through the activities of developers. The rate of social learning and accumulation of knowledge highly increases through adaptation and imitation. This raises questions regarding the relationship between the number of languages on GitHub and what this means for the pace of innovation. In natural languages, for example, language is considered as a barrier surrounding and protecting a culture and its identity and knowledge (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Pagel 2011</a>). These rings of language tend to slow the pace of adoption of ideas and therefore also the pace at which they flow through a global society. As a hub of collaborative activity, GitHub removes many of these barriers, but to what extent does this theory hold when different programming languages are deployed? At the very least, the interface is standardised; across the globe, everyone is subject to the same <i>grammars of action</i>. Formal artificial languages (e.g. programming languages) also remove some of these barriers of natural language, which would otherwise be a big issue for &ldquo;global software development&rdquo;. Clearly, there is much more territory worth exploring.</p>

			<h3 id="7-Conclusions">7. Conclusion</h3>
			<p>This research contributes to and elevates the contemporary academic debate on technicity as part of the broader project of software and platform studies. As such it informs the design and implementation of platforms that try to harness the many ways in which systems and information transparency can support collaborative innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building. By examining the constitutive relations between technical infrastructures and specified human actions, I have tried to show that software has the ability to produce and instantiate modes of collaboration that are specific to the environment in which that software is implemented. Systems of storage and versioning, access protocols, <i>grammars of collaboration</i>, <i>social regulation</i>, &ldquo;social learning&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Bandura 1977</a>), activity streams and visualisations, and so on, shape the conditions for these context-specific kinds of innovation, knowledge sharing, and community building to emerge.</p>
				<p>As a distributed system for revision control and source code management, Git prefers modes of collaboration that are episodic or continuous. This resulted in a different approach to projects as nested code assemblages to which communities are attached, and with issues acting as hooks. Among the implications is the replacement of software release cycles by &ldquo;perpetual beta&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">O&rsquo;Reilly 2005</a>), and cumbersome organisations by task-oriented development neighbourhoods that are formed because code is a social object that structures collaborative efforts. Free distribution and access to source code and implementation are essential to collaborative effort on GitHub, which lead me to rephrase the question of ownership as one of accessibility and permission protocols and lead to a discussion of how the public and private had been reconfigured on the Web towards a &ldquo;neodemocracy&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Dean 2003</a>). Implications of this shift concern the central role of issues as units of collaboration, and how these issues are tracked and integrated into the platform as searchable units or through task allocation and issue management. Because issues and tasks are concrete units of collaboration, they can be measured (e.g. lines of code, difficulty, date stamps), compared (<i>compare view</i>, <i>blaming</i>, <i>merging</i>), allocated (e.g. to trained professionals, amateurs), and processed by the system (e.g. activity metrics). This leads to particular forms of knowledge sharing and learning such as disconnected issue solving, tiny snippets of code, or <i>watching watching</i>. Information transparency and activity awareness can greatly enhance the coordination of distributed efforts. As a result of a predefined grammar of collaboration, every action can have &ldquo;an equal and opposite reaction&rdquo;<sup class="note"><a rel="internal anchor" href="#note83" class="anchor ahref-uri">83</a></sup> from the system that can be distributed (e.g. visualisation, notification, stream), which instantiates <i>social regulability</i> enabled by <i>recursive awareness</i>, and resulting in a complex system of social values such as status, skill, and reputation. In the discussions of <i>social forking</i>, <i>Gist</i>, and <i>(re-)merging</i>, it became clear that knowledge is shared through activity feeds and other automated systems that capture this activity. Information transparency and activity awareness make communities and their efforts visible and create opportunities for social learning and source code scrutiny.</p>
				<p>I propose to continue these efforts to develop a &ldquo;thick&rdquo; understanding of software and platforms, and the critical role that systems and code play in shaping the technicity of our everyday lives and problems. There is relatively little research on the role of software in this regard. At least not on how software is constitutive as both product and process; how code emerges. This is also why we need more situated studies to show how technicity has implications on the micro-level, and in order to understand to what extent a system interpellates people to its logic. Software is not just supporting human faculties; it is rather a complex constellation of negotiations between humans and technology. The implemented features convert collaboration into a coded (programmed) concept, which leads to workflows that are specific to the GitHub environment (e.g. <i>light-forks</i>, <i>social forking</i>, <i>episodic</i> and <i>continuous collaboration</i>, issue solving in disconnected instances, the use of <i>feature branches</i>, <i>(re-)merges</i>, the <i>fork and pull</i> workflow). Collaboration <i>becomes</i> in an informational environment of global/local mirroring of <i>captured</i> information, which also imposes particular <i>grammars of collaboration</i>. Specific technological constellations are constitutive of particular kinds of networks such as knowledge-based social learning networks, and task-oriented development communities, where projects exist as nested code assemblages, to which communities are attached through issues. On the other end, we also need studies that focus on larger power relationships that shape the development of platforms or software as part of larger &ldquo;ecosystems&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">van Dijck 2013</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Langlois 2011</a>; <a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Gillespie 2010). Related to this, and as van Dijck also stressed, we should also be deconstructing what meanings developers <i>impute</i> into the platform, its goals and its features (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2013, 11</a>). Technologies will keep changing, but an understanding of coded incentives could indicate broader discourse networks and provide insight into which direction the platform might evolve in the future.</p>

				<li id="note52">Dodge and Kitchin identified several such different kinds of programming: &ldquo;Programming extends from the initial production of code, to refactoring (rewriting a piece of code to make it briefer and clearer without changing what it does), to editing and updating (tweaking what the code does), to integrating (taking a piece of code that works by itself and connecting it to other code), testing, and debugging, to wholesale rewriting.&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">2011, 26, ch. 2</a>).</li>
				<li id="note53">Here I understand programming as not just the writing of machine-readable instructions for a machine, but &ndash; in line with Dodge and Kitchin &ndash; as having an &ldquo;ontological capacity&rdquo;: &ldquo;programming seeks to capture and enact knowledge about the world &ndash; practices, ideas, measurements, locations, equations, and images &ndash; in order to augment, mediate, and regulate people&rsquo;s lives&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">26</a>).</li>

				<li id="note63">As pointed out by Eric S. Raymond (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">1998</a>), Linus Torvalds&rdquo; Linux kernel is an ambitious project that did not start from scratch. Instead, he would start by reusing code and ideas from MINIX, which is an UNIX-like OS created by Andrew Tanenbaum for educational purposes. Raymond links this example to prove his point that &ldquo;good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;the source-sharing tradition of the UNIX world has always been friendly to code reuse&rdquo;.</li>
				<li id="note64">It is worth noting that fork trees are different from version trees. Fork trees are made of forks, whereas version trees are made of branches. As discussed earlier (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#4-2-Storage-and-Source-Code-Management-in-Git" class="anchor ahref-text">section 4.2</a>), branches and version trees are part of the Git index and storage systems. Forks, on the other hand, create &ldquo;schisms&rdquo; (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Hill 2005</a>) and are used to initiate new directions for independent development; are created from a <i>subset</i> of the complete project; and can link together features between communities, because they can be created from multiple predecessors (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Fung et al. 2012</a>).</li>
				<li id="note65">Andrew Barry argued in regard to what he called &ldquo;technological citizenship&rdquo; that interactivity is now the dominant model for producing subjects through objects.

Instead, they are <i>allowed</i> (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-text">Barry 2001, 129</a>).</li>
				<li id="note66">For example, see Lucy Suchman&rsquo;s ethnographic approach to &ldquo;situated actions&rdquo;, which holds that actions should not just be abstracted, because they are always the result of a complex interaction with material and social circumstances (<a rel="internal anchor" href="#10-Bibliography" class="anchor ahref-uri">1985, 35&ndash;46, ch. 4</a>).</li>
